					<p>
						Reduced Inequalities is a platform where the citizens of Nigeria (both young and adult) can get instant access to
						the latest opportunities around them for free.
					</p>
					<p>
						Being the tenth of the seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), Reduced Inequalities is intended to bridge the
						gap between the rich and the poor by providing a platform where all the citizens will be duly informed of the
						various opportunities around them. This will be an advantage to the citizens especially the users as it will help
						them to get direct access to some opportunities provided by the federal government, their state government and
						various NGOs.
					</p>
					<p>
						Hopefully, around 1.5million people throughout the country will benefit from the information and opportunities that
						will be shared on this platform by December 2021.
